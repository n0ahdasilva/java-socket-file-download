1.  myfileclient.java asks myfileserver.java for a text file
        The client sends a packet request to the server to find whether ascii.txt exists or 
        not. The server will send the client an acknowledgement of whether the file exists or not.

        The internet and the transport layer are at work here. The internet layer is responsible 
        for ensuring that the data is sent fast and accurately and also for reassembling the 
        data request packet at the server.

        The transport layer provides a connection between the server and the client. The server 
        acknowledges it has received data from the client and ensures that the client acknowledges 
        the packets it receives.

2.  myfileserver.java will check for the text file in the current directory and then send 
    an acknowledgement to myfileclient.java that the text file exists
        Once the client finds out that the file exists in the server, the server will check for 
        the file in the current directory. If the file is found, the server will send an 
        acknowledgement to the client that the file exists.

        The transport and internet layer are involved in this step due to the sending and 
        acknowledging of packets from the client and server.

3.  myfileclient.java outputs to the console that it found the file in the server
        After the file has been found and acknowledgement packets have been sent and received, 
        the client will print in the console terminal that the file has been found on the 
        server and display the log of sent and acknowledged packets.
